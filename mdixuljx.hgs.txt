 - In Project, added SystemSetupDS column to CreateProjectTables().  Bump rev to D5.
 - In AdcpDatabaseWriter, added SystemSetupDataSet to project db file.
 - In DbCommon, added COL_SYSTEMSETUP_DS.
 - In Cache, changed dictionary to ConcurrentDictionary.
 - In Commons, added NMEA_FILE_EXT to file extensions.
 - In Project, added Gps and NMEA writers.
 - In AdcpDatabaseCodec, read in ProfileEngineering, BottomTrackEngineering and SystemSetup datasets.
 - In Project, added GPS1, GPS2, NMEA1, NMEA2 columns to CreateProjectTables().  Bump rev to D6.
 - In AdcpDatabaseCodec, added GPS1, GPS2, NMEA1 and NMEA2 column to the project db file.

 - In Project, added AdcpGps column to CreateProjectTables().  Bump rev to D7.
 - In AdcpConfiguration, added VesselMountOptions to store vessel mount options.
 - In AdcpDatabaseWriter, removed the EnsembleNmea object and put the NMEA data in the ensemble.
 - In GpggaSentence, fixed a bug when parsing the Latitude and longitude.
 - In NmeaDataSet, added GPHDT.
 - Added VmHeadingSource.cs and VmHeadingOffset.cs.
 - In AdcpDatabaseWriter, write the position if the GPGGA message is given.
 - In DbCommons, Added COL_ENS_POSITION.
 - In AdcpDvlCodec, pass all the DVL data to as binary data to be recorded in SendData().
 - In PRTIXXXSentence, set the SubsystemConfig number as the same as the CEPO index in OnSentenceChanged(). 
 - In Firmware, in ToString(), display the SubSystemCode as a char.
 - In AdcpDatabaseCodec, fixed bug in WriteEnsembleDataToDatabase() where if GPS data was not present, the @position value was not set.
 - In PRTIXXXSentence, fixed constructor to take subsystem CEPO index.

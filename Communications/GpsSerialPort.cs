 * 09/01/2011      RC                     Initial coding
 * 12/08/2011      RC          1.09       Set Receive Buffer
 * 12/12/2011      RC          1.09       Added RecorderManager. 
 *                                         Record incoming data to RecorderManager.
 * 12/13/2011      RC          1.09       Added IsEnabled property.
 * 12/29/2011      RC          1.11       Added event for GPS serial data.
 * 02/29/2012      RC          2.04       Added a try/catch block in ReceiveDataHandler() to catch any issues so the serial port will not disconnect on issues.
 * 08/20/2012      RC          2.13       Set a default value for constructor of IsEnabled.

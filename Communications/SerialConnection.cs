 * 12/29/2011      RC          1.11       Adding log and removing RecorderManager.
 * 02/06/2012      RC          2.00       Improve the performance of the ReceiveBufferString when limiting the size.
 * 02/10/2012      RC          2.02       Made serial port and serial options PROTECTED so class that extend can use it.
 *                                         Added BREAK command.
 * 03/23/2012      RC          2.07       Added a wait in the Break command to ensure the state has time to change.
 * 03/30/2012      RC          2.07       Check for a break state when sending data.
 * 04/06/2012      RC          2.08       Added WAIT_STATE.
 *                                         Made the serial port private to protect against sending and receiving data incorrectly.
 *                                         Added IsOpen(), IsBreakState() and IsAvailable() to check status of serial port.
 *                                         Use a thread to read the data instead of an event handler.
 *                                         Added a shutdown method that must be called when destorying the object to stop the thread.
 * 04/12/2012      RC          2.09       Added ReadData() to manually read. 
 *                                         Added PauseReadThread() to pause reading data from the serial port.
 * 04/26/2012      RC          2.10       Added a default value to SendDataAndWaitReply().
 * 04/27/2012      RC          2.10       Added a sleep in the SendData() commands.
 * 07/09/2012      RC          2.12       Added locks to read and write methods for multithreading.
 * 08/21/2012      RC          2.12       Used IsAvailable() instead of checking each time for isOpen and !breakState when using the serial port.
 *                                         Made Connect() and Reconnect return a bool if a connection could be made.
 * 08/31/2012      RC          2.12       Changed the serial port ReadBufferSize to handle faster download speeds.
 * 09/21/2012      RC          2.15       Added SendDataGetReply() to send data and get the response back.
 * 10/18/2012      RC          2.15       In SendDataWaitReply(), when checking if the reponse matches the command, make the command and response both lower case so they will match in case.
 * 10/25/2012      RC          2.16       Added a check for IO exception in Connect(), to see if the port exist.
 * 04/26/2013      RC          2.19       Fixed IsAvailable() if the port is not open, it would get a null for BreakState.
 *                                         Set the initial port and baud rate given in the constuctor to the serial port.
 * 05/03/2013      RC          2.19       Fixed connecting multiple times to a serial port.  Threads were left running when multiple connections were attempted.
 * 05/15/2013      RC          2.19       Make a public property for SerialPortOptions to allow others to see the settings.
 * 05/17/2013      RC          2.19       Added ToString().
 * 05/23/2013      RC          2.19       Check for empty or null string in SendDataWaitReply().
 *                                         MAX_DISPLAY_BUFFER increased to ensure the entire HELP message can be displayed.
 * 06/28/2013      RC          2.19       Replaced Shutdown() with IDisposable.
 * 08/09/2013      RC          2.19.4     Added a soft BREAK in SendBreak() for connections that can not handle hard BREAKs.
 * 09/25/2013      RC          2.20.1     In SendDataWaitReply() check the response if it is a BREAK and handle differently.
 * 08/05/2014      RC          2.23.0     Force the thread to shutdown by sending an abort in Dispose().
 * 05/29/2015      RC          3.0.5      Moved displaying of the data to move the bottom.
 * 10/27/2015      RC          3.2.1      In Connect(), reinitialize the Read thread when reconnecting.
 * 12/12/2018      RC          3.4.11     Made the Wait States for Advanced BREAK doubles in SendAdvancedBreak().
